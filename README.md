# Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Constrained POMDPs

This is an implementation of CC-POMCP algorithm proposed by '[Lee et al., Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Constrained POMDPs, NIPS 2018](http://ailab.kaist.ac.kr/papers/LKPK2018)'.  The code is based on David Silver's POMCP implementation.

You can run the code simply as follows:

```
make
./run.sh
```
