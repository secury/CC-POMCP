# Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Constrained POMDPs

This repository contains the implementation of CC-POMCP algorithm of the paper:

"[Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Constrained POMDPs](http://ailab.kaist.ac.kr/papers/LKPK2018)", Jongmin Lee, Geon-Hyeong Kim, Pascal Poupart, Kee-Eung Kim. NIPS 2018.
The code is based on David Silver's POMCP implementation.
